 <item> <title>What College Acccreditation Changes Mean for Students</title>
 <link>http://blog.ed.gov/2016/06/college-accreditation-changes-mean-students/</link>
 <description>For millions of Americans, federal student loans and grants open the doors to a college education. That critical federal aid must be used at a school that is (among other things) given the seal of approval by an �accrediting agency� or �accreditor� recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. It�s one of the safeguards in the system. Accreditation is an important signal to students, families, and the Department about whether a school offers a quality education. Accreditors have a responsibility under federal law to make sure colleges earn that seal.</description>
